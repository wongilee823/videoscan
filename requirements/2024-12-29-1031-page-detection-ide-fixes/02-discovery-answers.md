**Date Answered:** 2024-12-29 10:35

## Q1: Should the page detection feature automatically identify and crop individual document pages from video frames?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** Confirmed - this is the core feature requirement

## Q2: Will users need to scan multi-page documents in a single video recording?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** Users will flip through pages one by one, and the web app should detect every page

## Q3: Should the page detection work in real-time during video recording/preview?
**Answer:** No (not sure, but probably not needed)
**Context:** Users just need to upload the video, post-processing is acceptable

## Q4: Will the system need to handle documents that are not perfectly aligned or at angles?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** The app needs to align documents automatically

## Q5: Should we fix all TypeScript errors in the IDE before implementing new features?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** Clean codebase is important, current errors are in supabase-server.ts

## Summary
- Users want to scan multi-page documents by flipping pages in a video
- Each page should be automatically detected and extracted
- Document alignment/straightening is required
- Post-processing approach is acceptable (not real-time)
- TypeScript errors need to be fixed first
