# Expert Requirements Answers - Page Detection & IDE Fixes

**Date Answered:** 2024-12-29 10:45

## Q6: Should the system store the detected corner coordinates in the database for each frame to enable re-processing or manual adjustments later?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** Only store coordinates for detected document pages, not every video frame

## Q7: Should page detection automatically trigger when the detected document boundaries remain stable for a certain duration (e.g., 0.5 seconds) to avoid capturing mid-flip frames?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** Ensures stable, non-blurry page captures

## Q8: Should the app provide visual feedback (like corner markers or bounding box) on detected pages in the final PDF preview before generation?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** Users can verify detection accuracy before finalizing

## Q9: Should the perspective correction algorithm prioritize rectangular output even if the actual document has slightly non-rectangular shape (e.g., slightly curved edges from paper curl)?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** Force rectangular output for better readability

## Q10: Should the system fall back to including all extracted frames (without page detection) if no valid document pages are detected in the video?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** Ensures users always get output rather than failure

## Summary of Expert Decisions
- Store corner coordinates for detected pages in database
- Implement stability detection to avoid mid-flip captures
- Provide visual preview with detection markers
- Force rectangular perspective correction
- Graceful fallback to all frames if detection fails
