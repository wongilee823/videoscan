# Discovery Questions - Page Detection & IDE Fixes

These questions will help understand the scope and context for improving automatic page detection and fixing IDE issues.

## Q1: Should the page detection feature automatically identify and crop individual document pages from video frames?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (this is the standard behavior for document scanning apps)

## Q2: Will users need to scan multi-page documents in a single video recording?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users often scan multiple pages sequentially)

## Q3: Should the page detection work in real-time during video recording/preview?
**Default if unknown:** No (post-processing is typically sufficient and less resource-intensive)

## Q4: Will the system need to handle documents that are not perfectly aligned or at angles?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (real-world scanning often involves imperfect positioning)

## Q5: Should we fix all TypeScript errors in the IDE before implementing new features?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (clean codebase ensures reliable development)
