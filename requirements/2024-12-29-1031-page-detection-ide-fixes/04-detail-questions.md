# Expert Requirements Questions - Page Detection & IDE Fixes

These detailed questions address specific implementation decisions now that we understand the codebase architecture.

## Q6: Should the system store the detected corner coordinates in the database for each frame to enable re-processing or manual adjustments later?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (allows users to refine detection results and provides audit trail)

## Q7: Should page detection automatically trigger when the detected document boundaries remain stable for a certain duration (e.g., 0.5 seconds) to avoid capturing mid-flip frames?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (ensures we capture stable, non-blurry page images)

## Q8: Should the app provide visual feedback (like corner markers or bounding box) on detected pages in the final PDF preview before generation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (allows users to verify detection accuracy before finalizing)

## Q9: Should the perspective correction algorithm prioritize rectangular output even if the actual document has slightly non-rectangular shape (e.g., slightly curved edges from paper curl)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (most documents are intended to be rectangular, correction improves readability)

## Q10: Should the system fall back to including all extracted frames (without page detection) if no valid document pages are detected in the video?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (ensures users always get some output rather than complete failure)
